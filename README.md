The game is a representative of the genre of "arkanoid", in which you need to beat the ball with a controlled platform, thereby breaking the prearranged "bricks" on the level, and when all the bricks will be broken, there is a transition to the next level.

When breaking a "brick" with a certain probability can fall out a "letter" - the so-called bonus, which is designed to diversify gamlay (ball splitting, increasing the width of the platform, transformation from the current state of the platform to the laser, the transition to the next level, etc.).

Also, from the very beginning of the game from certain places in the "border" appear monsters that will interfere with the movement of the ball, and for the destruction of which are awarded points. The points themselves, along with the player's name, number of lives and other indicators are presented in the right part of the playing field (for the destruction of bricks of different types also accrues a different number of points).

When you lose the ball (the situation when the ball overcomes the lower boundary of the level), the control of the platform is blocked, the platform itself begins to "melt" and takes away one life, after which there is an animation of rolling out a new platform.

When starting the game or moving to a new level, a special "mop" cleans the remaining bricks and replaces them with new bricks that correspond to the level we are on.
